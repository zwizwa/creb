if you need to change anything to the source files here, let me know at <tom@goto10.org>
i assume i can overwrite with my own version, without too much checking.

the main darcs archive for creb is at

	http://zwizwa.goto10.org/darcs/creb

i update like this:

* update from darcs tree
* update from sourceforge cvs
* briefly look over changes, take mine as master
* commit darcs + sourceforge
