Entry: A full synth
Date: Sun Nov 11 17:55:47 EST 2012

So, time to make some things come together.  I'd like to wrap up some
of the experiments with dynwav~ into a single, MIDI-controlled synth,
which is somewhat hard to do in Pd + it's not so easy to port to a
simple device / small code size.  Anyways, I'd like to go through the
motions once and what is better than bootstrapping it inside Pd.  The
product is a virtual analog (of course) using oversampled modules,
with no distinction between control or data signals.  It's also
supposed to be a playground for code generated with [1], but I'm
probably going for C first.
